        Dear reader and, possibly, future employer!
        <br>I am grateful to you for reading my resume.
        <br>If you're looking for a non-standard talent seeker, this is it.
        <br>If you imagine hiring employees is a gold mining process, then I would classify myself as someone who washes it out of a
        mountain river and relies on intuition, not as someone who opens a career and brings heavy equipment. ...
        <br>The main question is who do you need?</p>
